## Simple Java programs

This is where I keep a few simple Java programs I have made through the years, added in no particular order.

* GangeOeving: A program I made to help my daughter practise for a multiplication test
* GodJul: A program that prints a holiday greeting and a little christmas tree in the terminal
* Tekstanalyse: A program that opens a simple GUI where the user can write a short text, and then have the program count how many of the words start with a specific letter
